just observations from graph; statistical tests were not performed here!


starting with the graph for the attention question;
	- highest for non-interactive; suggests that users that are allowed to self-navigate are less focussed/concentrated on what they are doing next
	- message length SHORT might result into slightly higher attention, suggesting for longer messages people might loose focus
best [ I=FALSE ]


graph for mean squared error on answers (with respect to what we consider to be the correct answer)
	- best performance for SHORT messages with interactiveness, however interactive with long messages performs terrible; people maybe don't like
	  reading a lot of explanation / examples, which leads to them skipping the explanation and then perform bad on the task
	- making it non-interactive partly solves this issue for both SHORT and LONG; it "forces" users to still read the examples, so they perform better again
best all fine EXCEPT [ I=TRUE, L=LONG ]


role clarity
	- message length not really a factor; non-interactiveness has highest clarity, while allowing for interactiveness leads to lower role clarity
best [ I=FALSE ]

goal clarity
	- same as for role clarity; non-interactiveness has highest by a decent margin, while allowing for interactiveness only decreases it
	- no big difference between short and long messages
best [ I=FALSE ]


overall clarity
	- overall clarity was highest for long messages without interactiveness, suggesting that "forcing" people to read everything is a good thing
	- with shorter messages, the overall clarity is lower, suggesting that the long messages provide a more clear way of explaining
best = [ I=FALSE, L=LONG ]


OVERALL SUMMARY
we did not find any evidence that allowing for self-navigation through interactiveness has a positive effect; on the contrary, we actually showed it
to have a negative effect on the accuracy of the workers. The message length does not seem an important factor in most cases, however there were
two cases were the LONG messages showed an improvement while there were no advantages observed from using short messages. This suggests that overall
the non-interactive variant with long messages seems most favorable.
